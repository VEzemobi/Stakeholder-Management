Background
A business in Nigeria needed to increase customer engagement on its website while reducing dependency on call-in support. The agreed solution after requirements gathering was to incorporate a chatbot to handle basic customer inquiries online.

The Challenge
An influential stakeholder, the Head of Finance, resisted funding the chatbot project. His main concern was that the chatbot could lead to staff reduction within the Customer Service department, which was managed by his relative.

Engagement Strategy
Instead of insisting on the technical and financial merits of the project, I chose to build rapport and understanding. I discovered that the Head of Finance played lawn tennis, a sport I also enjoy. By joining his tennis club and partnering with him for doubles games, I gradually established trust and an informal connection.

Turning Point
One Saturday after a game, we stopped at a busy supermarket. Frustrated by the long checkout queue, he exclaimed, 'Why can’t they introduce self-checkout?' before leaving his basket and walking out. In that moment, I saw an opportunity to draw a parallel between his frustration and our project.

The Analogy
I explained that the long queues at the supermarket were similar to the long hold times customers experienced when calling the company. A self-checkout, I said, was like a chatbot — allowing customers to help themselves quickly and efficiently. The connection clicked, and the next workday, the project received funding approval.

Outcome
The chatbot was successfully funded and implemented. It improved customer engagement on the website, reduced call volumes, and provided faster service to customers seeking basic information. The stakeholder later became one of the strongest supporters of the project.
